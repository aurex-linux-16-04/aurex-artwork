This Theme was created for MDM, but if you want to use it with GDM just follow this instructions...

1. Go inside the theme file-container and change the name of the file "MdmGreeterTheme.desktop" to "GdmGreeterTheme.desktop"... from console would be something like this
	~ $ mv MdmGreeterTheme.desktop GdmGreeterTheme.desktop

2. Then edit the file GdmGreeterTheme.desktop from a console with gedit or vi editor
	~ $ gedit GdmGreeterTheme.desktop
   at the top you will see "[MdmGreeterTheme]" just change it for "[GdmGreeterTheme]"

3. Now the theme is ready to be use with GDM. Just copy the theme file-container to /usr/share/gdm/themes/ (you would need root permisions) and you should be able to use it!

Note: The theme includes 2 backgrounds for different resolutions, the one who would be working with the theme will be the one named "background"
